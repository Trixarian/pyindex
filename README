This is just a simple single process IRC Indexer script written in python.
It can be called by a bash script to run through a predefined list to
gather data from several networks at once hence removing the need for a
multi-threaded indexer all together.

It's released under the GNU General Public License so feel free to modify
it to suit your needs so long as you credit me with the base work.
A copy of the license can be found in the LICENSE file.

USAGE
-----
Just run ./pyindex server.address.here and the script will do the rest.
